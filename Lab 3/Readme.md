Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on 7-Segment Display


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program to display hexa-decimal values from 0 to F on the 7-segment display interfaced with digital pins of Arduino Uno board. Once the sequence completed from 0 to F then repeat the sequence again.

- **Code 2 -** Program to display a two digit decimal numbers from 00 to 99 using 7-segment LEDs. Use common digital pins of Arduino Uno  for both 7-segments LED connection and display the digit using multiplexing logic i.e one digit at a time on each 7-Segment with small delay values (few ms). Use a slide switch to stop the number sequencing.

- **Code 3 -** Program to design a token display system which helps to serve the customer without the need of standing in a queue. This display system consist of two 7-sevensgment display to display token numbers from 00 to 99, and token numbers are received into Arduino Uno via serial port from PC. For every token displayed on 7-segment activate the buzzer to alert the customer.


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
