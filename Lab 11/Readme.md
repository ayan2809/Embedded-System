Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on Inter Communication Between two Arduinos using SPI


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program program to implement a SPI communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduino as master and other as slave. Master is interfaced with 4x4 keypad and slave is connected with 16x2 LCD. Establish a SPI communication between master and slave display each key press on the master to the slave LCD. Simulate and verify this logic on Arduino Uno using Tinkercad circuits simulator.

- **Code 2 -** Program to implement a SPI communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduinos as master and other as slave. Master Arduino connected with LCD and slave Arduino connected with temperature sensor. Transfer temperature value read by slave to master and display it on LCD using SPI communication protocol. Simulate and verify this logic on Arduino Uno using Tinkercad circuits simulator.


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
