Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on Potentiometer and Temperature Sensor


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program to read the analog voltage value from potentiometer connected to one of the analog pins and print its value in a serial window.

- **Code 2 -** Program for controlling the speed of the DC motor by varying the potentiometer connected to one of the analog pin


- **Code 3 -** Program to design a voltage level indicator system using potentiometer and LEDs. The system must display the different level of the voltage with the help of 5 LEDs as per following conditions.
  - If the voltage is between 0 to 1V glow LED1
  - If the voltage is between 1 to 2V glow LED1 and LED2
  - If the voltage is between 2 to 3V glow LED1 to LED3
  - If the voltage is between 3 to 4V glow LED1 to LED4
  - If the voltage is between 4 to 5V glow LED1 to LED5


- **Code 4 -** Program to read the temperature value from TMP36 temperature sensor connected to one of the analog pin and print its Fahrenheit and Celsius value on serial window.


- **Code 5 -** Program to design a automatic room temperature control system to monitor the room temperature using TMP36 sensor and display its value on two digit 7-Segment display. Whenever the room temperature crosses 25°C the system must switch ON the Fan (DC motor with relay) to control the room temperature. Once the temperature goes below 25°C Fan must be switch OFF automatically.


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
