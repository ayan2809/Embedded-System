Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on various challenging experiments


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program program to implement a SPI communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduinos as master and other as slave. Master Arduino connected with LCD and slave Arduino connected with temperature sensor. Transfer temperature value read by slave to master and display it on LCD using SPI communication protocol.

- **Code 2 -** Program program to a digital stop with start/stop and reset option. This system consist of three 7-segment LED unit to display the timing in milliseconds precision.
    -	First and second 7-segment LED display seconds value
    -	The last 7-segment LED displays milliseconds value
    -	Use slide switch to start/stop the counting (HIGH-Start, LOW-Stop)
    -	Use push button to reset the counting to initial value (HIGH-Reset)
    -	Once it reaches it’s maximum counting, continue again with initial value

- **Code 3 -** Program program to design a simple calculator system that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operation. This system accept input numerals and operations from 4x4 alphanumeric key pad and display result on the LCD screen. Assume symbol “#” represent answer display (=) operation “A” perform addition, “B” perform “Subtraction, “C” performs multiplication and “D” perform division. 


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
