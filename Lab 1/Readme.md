Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on LEDs and switches


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program to blink three LEDs interfaced with three digital pins of Arduino Uno as per following sequence:
	- First turn ON Green LED for 15 Sec. while other LEDs in OFF state
    - Then turn ON Yellow LED for 3 Sec. while other LEDs in OFF state
    - Then turn ON Red LED for 10 Sec. while other LEDs in OFF state

- **Code 2 -** Program to control four LEDs in a Hexadecimal pattern from 0 (0000) to F (1111) in a sequential order with 0.5 Sec delay between each. Once it reach F, the sequence must continue again from 0.
- **Code 3 -** Program to control two LEDs (Green, Red) state using a switch as per following logic.
    - When switch is not pressed (LOW) turn ON Red LED continuously and Green LED in OFF state
    - Whenever switch is pressed (HIGH) turn OFF Red LED and turn ON Green LED for 10 Sec. 
    - After 10 Sec. delay turn OFF Green LED and proceed to turn ON Red LED continuously 
- **Code 4 -** Program to blink four LEDs one at a time from left to right with 0.5 sec delay. Whenever a switch is pressed, the LED blinking happens from right to left with delay of 0.25s between each LED. When the Switch is released again the sequence change to left to right with 0.5s delay
