Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on Inter Communication Between two Arduinos (I2C)


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program program to implement a I2C communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduino as master and other as slave. Master is interfaced with Switch (Push button) and slave is connected with LED. Establish a I2C communication between master and slave, blink a LED on slave whenever switch is pressed on Master. 

- **Code 2 -** Program to implement a I2C communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduino as master and other as slave. Both Arduino are attached with a LED & a push button separately. Master LED can be controlled by using slave Arduino’s push button and slave Arduino’s LED can be controlled by master Arduino’s push button using I2C communication protocol. 

- **Code 3 -** Program to implement a I2C communication between two Arduino Uno. Configure one of the Arduino as master and other as slave. Master Arduino connected with temperature sensor and slave Arduino connected with LCD. Transfer temperature value read by Master to slave and display it on LCD using I2C communication protocol.

Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
