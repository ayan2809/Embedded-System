Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on LCD and interfacing with different sensors


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program to to accept serial input from a host computer and displays it on the LCD. Assume LCD operates in 4-bit with EN and RS active state.

- **Code 2 -** Program for LCD to display “19BEC1872” at the beginning first line and “Ayan Sadhukhan” at beginning of the second line. Also print the number of seconds since the execution on first line 10th position and smiley in the second line last position.


- **Code 3 -** Program to measure the gas intensity using MQ series gas sensor and display it in serial monitor. Whenever gas concentration exceeds digital value of 500 then switch ON the alarm and LED.


- **Code 4 -** Program to measure the air quality using MQ series gas sensor and display it in LCD as “AirQ= XYZ ppm”, where XYZ is a CO2 value.


- **Code 5 -** Program to design a weather monitoring station which display temperature, CO2 level and light intensity on LCD. Print “Weather station” on first line and print the timing as “08:MM:SS” after a delay of 3 Seconds display values of temp, CO2 and light in a rolling display moving from right to lest direction. Then repeat the sequence again.


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
