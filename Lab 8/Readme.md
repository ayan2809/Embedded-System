Arduino Codes and their respective circuit diagrams on Servo Motor and LDR


## Description

- **Code 1 -** Program program to control the servo motor by rotating slowly from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, one degree at a time. When the motor has to be  rotated 180 degrees, it will begin to rotate in the other direction until it returns to the initial position. 

- **Code 2 -** Program to control rotation angle of the servo motor by rotating potentiometer knob. If the potentiometer at one end, the servo motor must be at 0 degree, when the knob is rotated to other extreme end the motor must reach 180 degree. Also display the Voltage value from potentiometer (1st row) and the present angle(2nd row) of servo motor on LCD.

- **Code 3 -** Program to design auto intensity street light controller. This system helps the street light to get switched on automatically as per surrounding brightness. For example, sometimes when the weather become hazy its quite difficult to see anything then at that point this auto intensity street light gets switched on based on present lighting condition. 


- **Code 4 -** Program to design a solar tracking system for harvesting solar energy efficiently by the solar panels. This system is constructed  by  fitting  two  LDRs, angled  away  from  each  other  by  around  90,  to  a  servo. Continuously read  the light  value  sensed  by  the  two  LDRs  and  rotates  the  servo so  that  each  is  receiving  equal  light.  As  a  sun-tracking  system  will  be  located  to  track  the  sun  from sunrise to sunset, i.e. not more than 180. Also, display both LDR values and present Servo motor position on LCD. 


Code can be run using the Arduino IDE or TinkerCAD.
